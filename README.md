# Personal Website of Andrew

Here will be the website of Andrew Sandoval with the following sections:

* An about page
    - As it sounds, contains information about me, who I am, things I like to do, what I'm interested in, etc.

* A projects page
    - This page will contain all the projects I've worked on (whether as a description with, with a demo, or a link to the project).

* An experiences page
    - This will contain info about all the previous experiences I have, either in the form of internships or full time jobs

* The home page
    - A page to welcome the users to the site

The overall goals of this project is to
1. Showcase all my work
2. Gain more practice in web development with popular tools such as React, HTML, CSS, etc.
